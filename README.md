# Data-structure
In this repo I have implemented all the data structure from scratch :
1. Linked List
2. Stack:
    A stack is linear data structure it based on LIFO principle.
    In the github repo we have implemented 
     1. Stack using array
     2. Dynamic Stack
     3. Generic Stack

3. Queue
    A Queue is linear data structure it based on FIFO principle.
    In the github repo we have implemented 
    1. Circulare Queue
    2. Dynamic Queue
    3. Generic Queue

4. Generic Tree
   Tree is a non-linear data structure and we have different types of tree so in this part we are implementing tree which can have n no of childs .

5. Bineary Tree
A tree is called binary tree if each node has 0 or atmost 2 nodes

7. Bineary Search Tree
It is a binary tree with additional property :
 - each node in left subtree<value of root node
 - each node in right subtree>value of root node

9. HashMap
10. Tries
11. Graph
12. Segmented Tree
13. Heaps

    
    
    
    Tree based but have atmost 2 childs and complete BT and plus it is a priority queue
